# Contributing to Gospel Metacasts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gospel Metacasts! This project is a labor of love, built to help people discover and engage with faith-promoting content from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in new and meaningful ways.

Whether you're a developer, metadata wrangler, designer, or someone who simply wants to help share the Gospel, your contributions are welcome.

## 🙌 Guiding Principles

- **Faithful Representation**: We strive to honor the original intent and spirit of the content we curate.
- **Respect for Sources**: All media is linked to official Church-hosted files or other faithful sources. We do not host or modify original media.
- **Open Collaboration**: Contributions are welcome from anyone who shares the mission to “make these things known to all the inhabitants of the Earth.”
- **Technical Stewardship**: We value maintainable code, clean metadata, and scalable architecture.

## 🧰 Ways to Contribute

You can help in many ways:

- 🗂️ Add or improve metadata for talks, scriptures, or podcasts
- 🧠 Suggest or implement new feed types (e.g., topical, speaker-based, scripture-based)
- 🧪 Help test and validate RSS feed generation
- 🌐 Build or refine the web interface for feed discovery
- 🧵 Normalize and enrich metadata (e.g., tags, durations, artwork)
- 📚 Document the project for new contributors
- 🛠️ Fix bugs or improve code structure

## 📝 How to Contribute

## 📦 Metadata Guidelines

- Ensure RSS feeds validate using standard podcast validators

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This is **not an official project of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints**. It is a community-curated collection of publicly available media and metadata. All media files are hosted by their original providers, and this project simply links to them via RSS.
