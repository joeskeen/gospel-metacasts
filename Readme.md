# Gospel Metacasts

**A curated, faith-promoting podcast archive for seekers and saints.**

Gospel Metacasts is an open-source initiative to make Gospel-centered media from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints more discoverable, accessible, and consumable through modern podcast platforms. By organizing metadata and generating RSS feeds, this project enables personalized listening experiences across decades of inspired content.

## 🙏 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- 📖 Promote deeper engagement with the teachings of Jesus Christ and His living prophets.
- 🎧 Make General Conference talks and other Gospel media available in podcast form.
- 🔍 Enable topical, speaker-specific, and scripture-based RSS feeds for tailored study.
- 🤝 Invite contributions from fellow believers who want to help "make these things known to all the inhabitants of the Earth."

## 🛠️ What’s Included

- A podcast feed of **all General Conference addresses from 1971 to present**, using metadata that links to official Church-hosted audio files.
- A metadata schema designed for extensibility and interoperability.
- RSS feed generation logic for various use cases.
- A roadmap for expanding content sources and user-facing tools.

## 📡 Roadmap

Here’s what’s planned and envisioned:

### ✅ Current Features

- General Conference podcast feed (1971–present)
- Metadata-only architecture (no media hosting)
- GitHub-based collaboration and contributions

### 🔜 Upcoming Milestones

- Speaker-specific feeds (e.g., all talks by President Nelson)
- Topic-based feeds (e.g., hope, repentance, revelation)
- Scripture-based feeds (e.g., Book of Mormon chapters as audio)
- Integration of third-party faithful podcasts into topical feeds
- Web interface for easy RSS discovery and subscription
- Metadata normalization and enrichment (e.g., tags, durations, artwork)
